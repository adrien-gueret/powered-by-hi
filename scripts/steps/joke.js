      question: "Why don't skeletons fight each other?",
      answer: "They don't have the guts!",
      explanation: `The joke is a play on words. "Guts" can mean two things here: literal internal organs, which skeletons don't have because they're just bones, or courage and bravery. The joke suggests that skeletons don't fight because they lack both the literal guts and the figurative "guts" or bravery to do so.`,
    },
    {
      question: "What do you call fake spaghetti?",
      answer: "An impasta!",
      explanation: `It's a play on words involving "impasta," which sounds like "impostor." The humor comes from labeling fake spaghetti as an "impasta," suggesting it's an impostor pretending to be real pasta. It's a pun where the likeness in sound between "impasta" and "impostor" creates a light-hearted and silly twist.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Why did the scarecrow win an award?",
      answer: "Because he was outstanding in his field!",
      explanation: `This joke plays on the phrase "outstanding in his field." It's a pun where "outstanding" can mean both "excellent" and "literally standing out in a field." Since a scarecrow stands out in a field and does a great job scaring birds away, it humorously suggests that this is why it won an awardâ€”both for being excellent and for being positioned in a field.`,
